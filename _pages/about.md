I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Emmanuel Dupoux, Olivier Pietquin and Florian Strub. I work in the <a href="https://cognitive-ml.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoML</a> team in Paris, which is a joint team between INRIA Paris, and ENS Paris.

Prior to that, I received an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique and a MSc degree in Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.

My research interests are at the crossroads of Machine Learning, Multi-agent RL, Language evolution and Cognitive science. My PhD projects aims at simulating language emergence in population of neural agents.
n Machine Learning, Optimization, Computer Vision and their applications to Robotics.
