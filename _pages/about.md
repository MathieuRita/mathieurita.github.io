I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Emmanuel Dupoux, Olivier Pietquin and Florian Strub. I work between the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/inria-joint-centre/">Inria-Microsoft Research Joint Lab</a> and the <a href="https://cognitive-ml.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoML</a> team in Paris, which is located at ENS Paris.

Prior to that, I received an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique and a MSc degree in Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.

My research interests are at the crossroads of Machine Learning, Multi-agent RL, Language evolution and Cognitive science. 

**My PhD project aims at simulating language emergence in population of neural agents with deep reinforcement learning.**
