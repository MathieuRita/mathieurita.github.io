I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Emmanuel Dupoux (ENS/FAIR), Olivier Pietquin (Google Brain) and Florian Strub (DeepMind). I work between the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/inria-joint-centre/">Inria-Microsoft Research Joint Lab</a> and the <a href="https://cognitive-ml.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoML</a> team in Paris, which is located at ENS Paris.

Prior to that, I received an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique and a MSc degree in Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.

*My research explores the theoretical and experimental aspects of training RL objectives with language models, with a specific focus on constructing self-play multi-agent systems. I particularly investigate how scaling populations and generations of agents can help address language learning challenges, such as overfitting, exploration or drift. As an application, I simulate language evolution and study the pre-requisites necessary to the emergence of language universals, such as compositionality.*
